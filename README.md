## Project Task 1: Diabetes Analysis

## Introduction
Diabetes is a global health crisis with far-reaching consequences. Early intervention is essential to prevent debilitating complications. This project employs data-driven analysis to explore the "Diabetes Prediction" dataset provided by PSYLIQ. Containing medical records for over 100,000+ patients, the dataset encompasses key health indicators including hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, and diabetes status. By utilizing MySQL, this study seeks to uncover critical patterns, identify high-risk populations, and inform strategies for improving diabetes care.

## Project Overview
The assessment consists of a series of SQL queries designed to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the diabetes dataset. The queries range from basic data retrieval to more complex operations involving subqueries, ranking, and data manipulation. This project also involves exploring various strategies for optimizing SQL queries, improving database schema design, and maintaining data integrity.

## Objectives
- **Analyze Healthcare Data:** Use SQL to analyze a large dataset of patient records, focusing on key health indicators such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and BMI.
- **Extract Insights:** Write SQL queries to retrieve specific information, rank patients based on health metrics, and group data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Optimize Query Performance:** Implement strategies to optimize the performance of SQL queries on large datasets, including indexing, query optimization, and schema normalization.
- **Improve Data Integrity:** Suggest improvements in the database schema to reduce redundancy, improve data consistency, and ensure efficient data management.

## Key Learnings
- **SQL Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience in SQL querying, data manipulation, and optimization, using advanced functions like `RANK`, `EXCEPT`, and subqueries.
- **Database Design:** Emphasized the importance of strategic database design to enhance data extraction efficiency and reduce redundancy.
- **Performance Optimization:** Learned how to optimize SQL queries for better performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Real-World Application:** Applied theoretical knowledge to analyze real-world healthcare data, revealing patterns that can inform better diabetes management practices.

## Project Task 2: Employee Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The project leverages Microsoft Excel to perform various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks. The work includes creating pivot tables, using functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and conditional formatting, automating tasks with Excel Macros, and developing dashboards to present key insights.

## Objectives
- **Analyze Employee Data:** Utilize Excel to explore various aspects of employee data, focusing on metrics such as job satisfaction, performance, and termination patterns.
- **Extract Insights:** Apply Excel formulas and pivot tables to retrieve specific information, group data, and create visualizations to uncover trends.
- **Automate Processes:** Use Excel Macros to automate repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
- **Create Dashboards:** Develop dashboards to provide a comprehensive view of workforce data, facilitating better HR decision-making.

## Project Task 3: HR Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of over 4,400 employees to address key HR-related questions. The primary goal was to derive actionable insights from the data to support strategic decision-making in workforce management. The analysis was conducted using advanced Excel techniques and Power BI to ensure comprehensive and accurate results.

## Objectives
- **Filter Datasets:** Display specific employee groups based on criteria such as age, department, and job role.
- **Create Pivot Tables:** Summarize data to show insights like average monthly income by job role or department.
- **Apply Conditional Formatting:** Highlight key metrics, such as employees earning above the company's average income.
- **Visualize Data:** Use charts and graphs to show trends like employee age distribution and attrition over time.
- **Establish Relationships in Power BI:** Link datasets, create calculated columns, and perform What-If analyses to explore different scenarios.
  
## Key Learnings
-**Data Visualization:** Gained experience in creating meaningful visualizations that aid in decision-making.
-**Power BI Integration:** Established relationships between datasets and implemented DAX formulas for deeper analysis.
-**Data Cleaning and Validation:** Ensured data accuracy by handling inconsistencies and validating against predefined schemas.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning, analysis, pivot tables, and visualization.
- **Power BI:** For data modeling, relationship building, and advanced visualization.
- **Canva:** For designing visually appealing presentation.
