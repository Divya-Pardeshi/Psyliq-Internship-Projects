## Project Task 1: Diabetes Analysis

## Introduction
Diabetes is a global health crisis with far-reaching consequences. Early intervention is essential to prevent debilitating complications. This project employs data-driven analysis to explore the "Diabetes Prediction" dataset provided by PSYLIQ. Containing medical records for over 100,000+ patients, the dataset encompasses key health indicators including hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, and diabetes status. By utilizing MySQL, this study seeks to uncover critical patterns, identify high-risk populations, and inform strategies for improving diabetes care.

## Project Overview
The assessment consists of a series of SQL queries designed to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the diabetes dataset. The queries range from basic data retrieval to more complex operations involving subqueries, ranking, and data manipulation. This project also involves exploring various strategies for optimizing SQL queries, improving database schema design, and maintaining data integrity.

## Objectives
- **Analyze Healthcare Data:** Use SQL to analyze a large dataset of patient records, focusing on key health indicators such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and BMI.
- **Extract Insights:** Write SQL queries to retrieve specific information, rank patients based on health metrics, and group data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Optimize Query Performance:** Implement strategies to optimize the performance of SQL queries on large datasets, including indexing, query optimization, and schema normalization.
- **Improve Data Integrity:** Suggest improvements in the database schema to reduce redundancy, improve data consistency, and ensure efficient data management.

## Key Learnings
- **SQL Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience in SQL querying, data manipulation, and optimization, using advanced functions like `RANK`, `EXCEPT`, and subqueries.
- **Database Design:** Emphasized the importance of strategic database design to enhance data extraction efficiency and reduce redundancy.
- **Performance Optimization:** Learned how to optimize SQL queries for better performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Real-World Application:** Applied theoretical knowledge to analyze real-world healthcare data, revealing patterns that can inform better diabetes management practices.

## Summary
This project provided invaluable experience in applying SQL to address a critical healthcare challenge. By analyzing the PSYLIQ Diabetes Prediction dataset, I successfully extracted meaningful insights and developed strategies for optimizing data management. The project's findings contribute to a deeper understanding of diabetes risk factors and inform evidence-based approaches to prevention and care.

## Project Task 2: Employee Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The project leverages Microsoft Excel to perform various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks. The work includes creating pivot tables, using functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and conditional formatting, automating tasks with Excel Macros, and developing dashboards to present key insights.

## Objectives
- **Analyze Employee Data:** Utilize Excel to explore various aspects of employee data, focusing on metrics such as job satisfaction, performance, and termination patterns.
- **Extract Insights:** Apply Excel formulas and pivot tables to retrieve specific information, group data, and create visualizations to uncover trends.
- **Automate Processes:** Use Excel Macros to automate repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
- **Create Dashboards:** Develop dashboards to provide a comprehensive view of workforce data, facilitating better HR decision-making.

## Key Learnings
- **Excel Proficiency:** Improved skills with Excel functions including VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and pivot tables for detailed data analysis.
- **Automation with Macros:** Implemented Macros to automate repetitive tasks, streamlining the analysis process.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Designed dashboards for effective data visualization, aiding in clear and actionable insights.
- **HR Analytics:** Gained insights into how data analysis can inform strategic HR decisions and improve workforce management.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel:** For data analysis, automation, and visualization.
- **Canva:** For designing polished presentation.
